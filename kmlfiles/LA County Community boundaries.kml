With just one elementary school, Ann Street, it’s one of the most obscure corners of downtown. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2013/03/06/california-fools-gold-exploring-the-north-industrial-district-los-angeless-dogtown/]]></description>

The first Chinatown was demolished to allow for the construction of Union Station and the new one opened in 1938.

Beginning around the turn of the 20th century, it was a large neighborhood and home to thousands of Japanese-Americans. During World War II, the residents were relocated to concentration camps and the vacated area became home to many black Angelenos and was known as Bronzeville. After the internment of Japanese-Americans ended, they returned in much reduced numbers to Little Tokyo. Even though most Japanese-Americans moved elsewhere, its status as the cultural heart of Japanese Los Angeles was restored and in 1995 it was declared a National Historic Landmark District. In more recent years, many of the businesses and residences have become increasingly Korean-American although they’ve, for the most part, preserved and even restored much of the neighborhood’s Japanese charm and character.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/02/05/california-fools-gold-exploring-little-tokyo-%E5%B0%8F%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC/]]></description>

After much of the industry left the area, in the 1970s it began to attract artists and became known as the Artists District. Venues like the now-gone Al’s Bar and parties held in abandoned buildings coexisted with drug abuse, homelessness and prostitution. Around the turn of the 21st century, real estate developers began to convert many of the old buildings to attractive (and expensive) residences that commodified a slightly gritty, artist lifestyle whilst pricing out many of the area’s resident artists.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/10/22/california-fools-gold-exploring-the-arts-district/]]></description>

In the 1940s the hillside slum was a frequent setting for many film noirs. In 1955, the neighborhood was demolished and replaced with skyscrapers. Today it’s an important center of LA’s fine arts scene, home to the Ahmanson Theatre, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, LA Opera, Los Angeles Philharmonic, MOCA, Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County, Walt Disney Concert Hall and Redcat.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2015/12/12/california-fools-gold-exploring-bunker-hill/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The design, distribution and warehouse center of the clothing, accessories and fabric industries used to be known variously as the Textile District, the Fabric District and the Garment District. In a bit of clever re-branding it became known as The Fashion District. While counterfeit goods, bootleg DVDs and the illegal trade of animals that happen around Santee Alley seemingly have little to do with fashion, events like Unique LA at the LA Fashion Market reflect the other end of the spectrum. Still, it’s not exactly Milan orParis.<br><br>https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=v3tDCB71XRpm5MH%2bop0sMA%3d%3d]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the 1930s and especially the ’40s, South Central Avenue was the center of West Coast Jazz. At the time, even superstars like Duke Ellington who played around Los Angeles still had to stay in South Central. Although the most famous, the Dunbar, was located in South Park, there were numerous other jazz and blues clubs on South Central. After the restrictive housing codes were abolished, this Harlem of the West dissipated as the population dispersed, jazz declined in popularity, and the neighborhood fell into disrepair.<br>Nowadays South Central is 87% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran), 10% black, 1% white and 1% Asian. It’s one of the more urbanized areas of the Eastside and, depending on where one draws the dividing line between Downtown and South Central (e.g. the 10 Freeway or W Washington Boulevard), its home to most of the iconic buildings in the region including Allied Architects Association‘s Bob Hope Patriotic Hall, the 13-story LA Mart, and the 14-story Art Deco 155 West Washington Boulevard building, built in 1927.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2014/02/06/is-bustin-a-cap-is-really-fundamental-exploring-south-central-for-black-history-month-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[South Park is a neighborhood that lies directly south of South Central and is centered around a park of the same name. Before 1948 it was as far south as blacks were allowed to live (aside from Watts) with Slauson forming its southern border. Around 1952, the neighborhood saw the formation of The Slausons, a black gang which organized to protect blacks from attacks by racist whites hoping to keep them from moving south of Slauson. Most of the black population eventually moved elsewhere and today South Park is 79% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran), 19% black and 1% white.<br><br>South Park is also fairly devoted to small-scale industries such as machine shops, auto shops, upholsterers, medical suppliers, etc, much like the Furniture and Decorative Arts District to the east. Notably, it is home to the tallest structure in the region, the 12-story Mount Zion Towers, built in 1971. It’s also home to the stunning, Rudolph Schindler-designed Bethlehem Baptist Church. It’s most famous building, however, is the famed Dunbar Hotel. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/08/05/california-fools-gold-a-south-los-angeles-eastside-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In 1907, Watts was incorporated as its own city, named after Watts Station, then a major stop for the Pacific Electric Railway‘s Red Car line between Los Angeles and Long Beach. Most of the residents were white and Mexican traqueros who worked on the line.<br><br>Watts became mostly black in the 1940s, when southern blacks settled there in search of industrial jobs. In 1965, it was the epicenter of the Watts Riots which saw part of the city burnt to the ground and nicknamed“Charcoal Alley.” It was plagued by gangs like the Watts Cirkle City Piru Bloods, Grape Street Watts Crips, Bounty Hunter Watts Bloods and PJ Watts Crips during the 1970s and ’80s which contributed to black flight. Today Watts is 62% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran) and 37% black. Although there have been attempts to turn around the neighborhood’s decline, it still suffers from the highest crime rate in the region.<br><br>It’s famously home to the Watts Towers, built by Italian immigrant construction worker Sabato Rodia between 1921 and 1954, probably one of LA’s five most recognized landmarks. Rodia himself named the structure “Nuestro Pueblo.”<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2014/02/14/more-than-just-riots-and-towers-exploring-watts-for-black-history-month-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

      <description>Solano Canyon is a tiny neighborhood nestled in the southern part of Elysian Park and bordering Chinatown to the south. The heart of the neighborhood is San Conrado Catholic Mission. It’s a tight-knit community with its own community garden that’s almost completely residential and a bit like an urban Rivendell except when Dodger games are on and traffic pours into its streets like the armies of Mordor.</description>

      <description><![CDATA[Wilshire Center has historically been the largest neighborhood in Midtown. Contained within it are the smaller neighborhoods of Little Bangladesh and Koreatown. However, as Koreatown has effectively (and now officially) grown, Koreatown has come to dominate Wilshire Center rather than the other way around. However, it is still marked by neon signs and the population is mostly Latino, 54% — mostly Mexican but with large numbers of Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Oaxacans. If Wilshire Center has a heart, it’s Wilshire Boulevard, Reflecting the ethnicity of most of its inhabitants to the north, it’s the site of The Consulate General of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and South Korea. The rest of the population is 32% Asian (mostly Korean), 7% white and 4% black.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/14/california-fools-gold-a-midtown-primer/]]></description>

Like many ethnic enclaves in LA, Koreatown is largely a Korean commercial district, although there are many newly-arrived and mostly poor Koreans living in the neighborhood… joining a population that’s largely poor and mostly Latino. When Koreatown was officially designated in 1980, Koreatown was limited to Olympic Boulevard. However, as the Korean population and businesses have poured out in all directions, definitions have grown to include all of Wilshire Center and parts of neighboring districts, and not without controversy. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/05/17/california-fools-gold-exploring-koreatown-%EC%BD%94%EB%A6%AC%EC%95%84%ED%83%80%EC%9A%B4/]]></description>

In the 1960s, many Bangladeshis came to the US on student visas and many chose to live in the northern portion of Wilshire Center for its cheap rents and its close proximity to LACC. After the Bangladeshi Liberation War broke out in March of 1971, there was one more reason to relocate. That same year the Los Angeles Bangladesh Association was created. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/05/17/1186/]]></description>

It’s not the first time the popular media image of a Los Angeles neighborhood has had practically nothing to do with reality. It’s also home to the first location of Walt Disney studios and the current home of Glenn Danzig.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/11/16/california-fools-gold-exploring-los-feliz-the-mideast-sides-pill-hill/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Atwater Village began as a poppy field known as “Atwater Park,” named after Harriet Atwater Paramore. It was subdivided in 1912 and became Atwater Village. Most of the Spanish-style homes and bungalows were built beginning in the 1920s. One of the oldest restaurants in the county, the Tam O’Shanter Inn, opened in 1922 and was frequented by Walt Disney. The Los Feliz Drive-In opened in 1950 at the corner ofRiverside and Los Feliz although it only lasted six years. Many of the early residents were employees of the nearby DWP station. Nowadays the diverse population is 51% Latino (mostly Mexican), 22% white and 20% Asian (mostly Filipino).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2014/11/30/california-fools-gold-exploring-atwater-village/]]></description>

Today the population is 66% Latino (mostly Mexican), 17% Asian (mostly Filipino) and 14% white. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2014/08/05/breadbaskets-and-head-gaskets-exploring-glassell-park/]]></description>

This is despite the fact that the neighborhood is made up mostly of single-family homes and few businesses, in contrast to high density and very commercial K-Town. In the silent era Wilshire Park was home to several famous actresses.

An economic slowdown in 1921 slowed down sales of the mostly-Colonial Revivals (and one Moorish and Scottish-influenced castle – The Chateau LeMoine) set on large lots and it became known as South Brookside (and later just Brookside) for the Arroyo de los Jardin de las Flores that runs through it. Since the 1930s, the privately-owned Brookledge Theater, located in the back of a home, has hosted magicians for entertainment. There’s also an annual potluck with a petting zoo and carnival games.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/14/california-fools-gold-a-midtown-primer/]]></description>

In the case of LA’s Olympic Park, however, it’s a small Mid-Wilshire neighborhood bound by Pico to the south, Rimpau to the west, Olympic to the north and Crenshaw to the east. There is no entry on it in Wikipedia or the LA Times Mapping Project… oh well! It’s also home of the Queen Anne Recreation Center.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/14/california-fools-gold-a-midtown-primer/]]></description>

Due to their passing aesthetic similarity to Bronzeville, Chicago‘s Robert Taylor Homes and Queens’s Queensbridgehousing developments; Park La Brea was quickly nicknamed “The Projects.” However, the inspiration was the innovative architecture of Le Corbusier and the streets are laid out in a Masonic pattern as a reference to the masonic heritage of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.</description>

Many of the homes serve as fine architectural examples of the American Arts and Crafts Movement. Along its outer edge there are several auto shops and a handful of restaurants. Although it’s semi-gated and the pedestrian entrances have dumb, permanently locked chain-link gates, they’re easily-hopped allowing Angelenos a chance to check out the neighborhood the predates the fences by about 90 years.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/14/california-fools-gold-a-midtown-primer/]]></description>

It’s also home to Southern California‘s oldest school, Loyola High. The population is roughly 66% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran), 16% black and 13% Asian.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/14/california-fools-gold-a-midtown-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Less touristy than Downtown Hollywood to the north, Central Hollywood is nonetheless home to Amoeba Music and the Cinerama Dome, built in 1963 and located across the street. It’s also home to Hollywood’s tallest building, Sunset Vine Tower, which was featured prominently in the 1974 disaster film, Earthquake. Later it was plagued with problems including the presence of asbestos, electrical fires and the popular perception of it being the world’s biggest crackhouse. Nowadays it’s been nicely, if expensively, refurbished. Central Hollywood is also home to the Gower Gulch shopping center and a Ross that continually looks like it was looted during a massive earthquake.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/03/26/california-fools-gold-a-hollywood-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hollywoodland is home to the 45 foot tall Hollywood Sign mounted on Mount Lee. It was originally erected in 1923 to advertise Woodruff and Shoults‘s then-newly-developed Hollywoodland subdivision. The “land” part of the sign was removed in 1949 so that the remaining Hollywood sign could serve as an icon of the entire Hollywood district and entertainment industry. The Hollywood sign that stands today was erected in 1978 and quickly became popular in establishing shots for films set in LA. Because of its exposure, it attracts tourists eager to stand near a big sign. And the people living in the neighborhood, knowing this fact full well, often tear their hair and flesh, beat their breasts, and wake other pitiable demonstrations because of it.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/03/26/california-fools-gold-a-hollywood-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Outpost Estates is a neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills centered along Outpost Drive. It was developed in the 1920s by by Charles E. Toberman. As with its neighbor, Hollywoodland, Outpost Estates also advertised itself with a large sign. Unlike Hollywoodland, whose sign (after the removal of the “land”) remains a tourist destination, the once neon-lit Outpost sign lies in ruin, obscured by weeds.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/03/26/california-fools-gold-a-hollywood-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I know some people will take issue with my inclusion of WeHo with the Westside. Well the Beverly Hills adjacent city has to fit in somewhere and it feels a lot more Westside to me than the Hollywood region (which, unlike West Hollywood, is all part of Los Angeles). With a population that’s 81% white (mostly Russian, German and Ukrainian), 9% Latino, 4% Asian and 3% Black it also looks like the rest of the Westside. It’s also where the Sunset Strip begins, home to many famous venues including The House of Blues, The Key Club, The Viper Room, The Roxy, The Whiskey A Go Go… and The Troubadour just a few blocks south on Santa Monica Blvd. Finally, La Cienega (which passes through it) is most-identified by Angelenos as the being the border between the Westside and Central Los Angeles.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/08/18/california-fools-gold-a-westside-primer/]]></description>

Indeed, as the home of the Silent Movie Theater and Canter’s Deli, it’s an intrinsic part of the so-called Kosher Canyon, Fairfax Boulevard. It’s also home to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and realtors often refer to it as “Beverly Hills Adjacent.” <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/08/18/california-fools-gold-a-westside-primer/]]></description>

The new Century City, its name a nod to it’s former owners, was reimagined as a “city within a city.” The first building, Century City Gateway West, was erected in 1963 followed by Minoru Yamasaki‘s Century Plaza Hotel — two of the first skyscrapers erected in the area after the lifting of earthquake-related height restrictions. Today it’s mainly a business center with numerous law firms and entertainment industry offices.

      <description><![CDATA[Little Osaka (小大阪) is a small district centered along Sawtelle Boulevard between Nebraska and Tennesee in the Sawtelle neighborhood of Los Angeles. In the 1920s and 30s, what’s now Little Osaka was dominated by Japanese-owned nurseries. By 1941, there were 26 nurseries in the area. When Japanese-Americans were unjustly interred during World War II, the neighborhood went into decline. Today it retains a diminished but strong Japanese character (including several nurseries) and is a J-Town favored by trendy Japanese, foodies, otaku, hentai and nipponophiles. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/12/09/california-fools-gold-exploring-little-osaka-%E3%83%AA%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E5%A4%A7%E9%98%AA/]]></description>

It’s home to Gramercy Park, 2nd Avenue Park, Johnny’s Pastrami, and the lengthily named Exceptional Children's Foundation School for Retarded Children. Its William Andrews Clark Memorial Library was built around the collection of rare books left by the son of a railroad baron/banker/politician. There are many nice Victorian homes, including the beautiful Joseph Dupuy Residence (now the South Seas House, for its Polynesian influence). There’s also the Wilfandel Club House, the oldest black women’s clubhouse in the city.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/11/29/california-fools-gold-a-south-los-angeles-westside-primer/]]></description>

It was formerly known as Newmark, named after a prominent grocer/historian, Harris Newmark. When oil was discovered in 1917, it quickly changed from an agricultural area to a more developed one. Its name was changed to Montebello at the suggestion of William Mulholland when it was incorporated in 1920.

      <description><![CDATA[Alhambra is named after Washington Irving‘s book Tales of the Alhambra, not after the Alhambra palace in Spain. It was founded in 1903 and, being a fairly old (by American standards) city, it’s home to many old homes in the Craftsman, Bungalow, Spanish Mediterranean, Spanish Colonial, Italian Beaux-Arts and Arts & Crafts styles. Alhambra was home to Phil Spector, who murdered actress Lana Clarkson in his home in 2003. The historic Garfield Theatre was an impressive Vaudeville venue rumored to have hosted The Gumm Sisters (featuring Judy Garland). It later showed Chinese films as it and the surrounding area become more Asian before going out of business in 2001 (to become, arguably, even more Asian with the addition of a Yogurtland and Energy Karaoke). Today the diverse population is 47% Asian (mostly Chinese and Vietnamese), 36% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 14% white. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2007/11/05/alhambra-the-gateway-to-the-san-gabriel-valley/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[San Marino is the wealthiest city in the San Gabriel Valley. With a plurality of San Marino residents coming from Chinese-speaking backgrounds (47% Asian, mostly Taiwanese and Chinese), 44% white (mostly English) and 5% Latino), San Marino is, as with San Gabriel, similarly nicknamed Chan Marino. San Marino was established in 1913 as an exclusively residential town with grand mansions set on large yards with wide streets and lush parkways. Fittingly, it’s the location of the renowned Huntington Library and gardens, the Japanese garden of which served as Japan in the classic film Beverly Hills Ninja. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2008/04/29/852/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Industry (or City of Industry) is an industrial suburb where there’s a MacDonald’s that’s only used for commercials and films (e.g. Mac & Me). The city’s zoning is primarily devoted to business: 92% is Industrial, 8% is Commercial. The main industries are cheese and tortilla factories and the garbage trucks actually run on cheese by-products. One of the factories was where the Terminator was crushed in The Terminator. The Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum is located in the City of Industry. The tiny population is 62% Latino (mostly Mexican), 24% white (mostly Danish) and 9% Asian (mostly Taiwanese).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/01/25/california-fools-gold-exploring-the-city-of-industry-2/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the first half of the 20th century, Boyle Heights was an ethnically diverse gateway to LA for recent immigrants mainly from East Asia (mainly Japan), Eastern Europe (mainly Armenia and Russia) and Latin America (mostly Mexico). In the northwest, there’s the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights which was mainly Jewish and its Breed Street Shul is the oldest synagogue on the west coast. The neighborhood of Arroyo Seco (not to be confused with the region of Northeast LA) in the Flats was home to one of the nation’s most notorious slums until the 1940s. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/01/28/california-fools-gold-exploring-boyle-heights/]]></description>

The name comes from a large boulder which, at certain times of the day, casts a shadow that looks like a flying bird.

      <description><![CDATA[Much of Glendale is located in the Verdugo foothills. José María Verdugo‘s son built the Catalina Verdugo Adobe, the oldest home in the city, the third largest city in Los Angeles County. In the 1920s and 1970s, large waves of Armenians moved to the city. Today the population is 54% white (mostly Armenian, Persian, and Arab), 20% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 16% Asian (mostly Filipino and Korean). It’s the birthplace of musicians Captain Beefheart, Elvin Bishop, Armen Chakmakian, John C. Debney, Scott Gorham, Linkin Park’s Joe Hahn, W.A.S.P’s Chris Holmes, Ed King, The Offspring’s Greg Kriesel and Sam Phillips. Movies filmed in Glendale include Double Indemnity, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Good Girl, Trees Lounge, Rock Star, How Stella Got her Groove Back, The Trouble with Angels, Big Fat Liar, and Vacation.

The first lots in Claremont went up for sale in 1887. Today it’s widely known for its schools (Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Pitzer College, Pomona College, Scripps College, Claremont Graduate University and the Claremont School of Theology) and many trees, which have lead to it being nicknamed the “City of Trees and PHDs.” It’s well known to music fans as the home of radio’s KSPC. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/04/20/california-fools-gold-exploring-claremont-the-city-of-trees-and-phds/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Burbank is named after a dentist, Dave Burbank. In the 1930s, Lockheed moved there and became the Valley’s largest employer. One of my first jobs was working at the no longer extant Penny Lane in Old Town Burbank. Although I didn’t work there long, I ate and drank my way around the Old Town area. Along with the rest of the Rock ‘n’ Roll Monday crew, I used to go to the Blue Room not infrequently. For entertainment, I’d sometimes ride the elevators at the Holiday Inn. The population is 59% white (mostly Armenian and Iranian), 25% Latino (mostly Mexican), 9% Asian, and 2% black. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/07/22/california-fools-gold-exploring-burbank/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Monterey Park, as mentioned earlier, was the first Asian-American majority in continental US. In the 1970s and 1980s, many affluent Taiwanese immigrants moved abroad from Taiwan and began settling into Monterey Park. In the 1980s, Monterey Park was also referred to as “Little Taipei” or, affectionately (and rather optimistically), “The Chinese Beverly Hills.” By the late 1980s, immigrants from China, Hong Kong and Vietnam began moving into Monterey Park and many of the established Taiwanese-American pioneers moved to wealthier communities in the valley. Today the population is 61% Asian (mostly Chinese and Vietnamese), 29% Latino (mostly Mexican), 7% white. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2010/09/23/california-fools-gold-exploring-monterey-park-%E8%92%99%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%9B%AD/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Compton is an infamous city that is practically synonymous around the world with the South Los Angeles region of which it is part. Due largely to the mythologizing NWA and their gangsta rap followers, Compton has also become a byword for urban squalor and gang violence even though (not to make anyone feel old) nearly a quarter of a century has passed since the release of Straight Outta Compton. Naturally the city has changed a great deal in the time that saw Ice Cube go from rapping about rape and murder to starring in children’s movies. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/02/23/california-fools-gold-exploring-compton-los-angeles-countys-hub-city/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[San Gabriel grew up around the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. In 1852 it became the original township of Los Angeles County, which is why some people call it the “Birthplace of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area.” Its twelve-acre San Gabriel Square Plaza is colloquially known as the “Chinese Disneyland” (although the Los Angeles Times humorously called it “The Great Mall of China.” The city itself is colloquially known as “Chan Gabriel.” All those Chinese puns are a result of the demographics: 49% Asian (mostly Chinese and Vietnamese), 30% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 17% white. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/11/10/california-fools-gold-exploring-san-gabriel-a-city-with-a-mission/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Although Pasadena is most famous for hosting the annual Rose Bowl football game and Tournament of Roses Parade, Pasadena is known to Angelenos as a center full of scientific, cultural and learning institutions including the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena City College (PCC), Fuller Theological Seminary, Art Center College of Design, the Pasadena Playhouse, the Norton Simon Museum of Art and the Pacific Asia Museum. On the screen it’s the setting of Brothers & Sisters and The Big Bang Theory. It’s mentioned in that Beach Boys song, too. It’s the seventh largest city in LA County and large parts of the community exist in the San Gabriel Valley, which it’s often considered to be part of. It’s not only the youngest city in the Verdugos, but also the most diverse, with a population that’s 39% white (mostly English), 33% Latino (mostly Mexican), 14% black and 10% Asian (mostly Filipino). <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/01/04/california-fools-gold-exploring-pasadena-the-crown-city-of-roses/]]></description>

      <name>Lincoln Heights</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Lincoln Heights is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, dating back to the 1830s and for several decades a wealthy Victorian neighborhood. With the arrival and development of of industry along the river, however, most of the wealthy residents moved first away. One of the first big groups to fill the void was Italian-Americans, who largely abandoned Little Italy after it became Chinatown. Over time, like the rest of LA, it grew more homogeneous and Latino. Its park, Lincoln Park, is where that one band took its name from. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/03/08/california-fools-gold-exploring-lincoln-heights-the-pueblos-bedroom/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The town of Altadena‘s beginnings were with Woodbury Ranch, established by Marshalltown, Iowa natives Capt. Frederick Woodbury and his brother, John. Five years earlier, a nursery, “Altadena Nursery,” had briefly operated in the area. For much of its early history, Altadena attracted wealthy whites from the East. A portion of Mariposa Street was nicknamed “Millionaires Row.” In the 1960s and ’70s, large numbers of black residences moved in after many white residences moved to the westside after the arrival of freeways to the area. The most famous road in Altadena is Christmas Tree Lane, a California Historical Landmark. Altadena’s population today is 40% white (mostly English andLebanese), 31% black, 20% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 4% Asian. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/07/17/california-fools-gold-exploring-altadena-the-community-of-the-deodars-2/]]></description>

Historically is known as “The End of the Santa Fe Trail,” it was established around 1849 on an oasis by immigrants from Arkansas, Missouri and Texas in search of gold. Later, El Monte produced television gold and the city is considered the birthplace of TV variety shows such as Hometown Jamboree, a KTLA-TV show, which was produced at the American Legion Stadium there in the 1950s, hosted by Cliffie Stone. The modern population of El Monte is 73% Latino (mostly Mexican), 19% Asian (mostly Chinese and Vietnamese) and 7% white. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2013/01/23/california-fools-gold-exploring-el-monte-the-end-of-the-santa-fe-trail-or-at-least-some-trails/]]></description>

      <name>Byzantine-Latino Quarter</name>
      <description><![CDATA[The Byzantine-Latino Quarter is a small district within Pico-Union. Historically it was nicknamed Greek Town due to a concentration of Greek residents and businesses. Although few Greeks live in the area today, St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral still draws Greek churchgoers. As were the Greeks, many of the neighborhood’s newer immigrants fled chaos and violence at home and nowadays the area is home to large numbers of Zapotecs, Mixtecs, Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and Hondurans. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2013/03/12/california-fools-gold-exploring-the-byzantine-latino-quarter-los-angeles-old-greektown/]]></description>

      <name>Santa Catalina Island</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Santa Catalina Island, usually simply referred to as Catalina, is 194 square kilometers in area. Its tallest point is 648 meter high Mount Orizaba. Its population comprises 99.8% that of the combined islands. Unlike the other four southern islands, no signs of pre-Tongva use have thus far been discovered. The band of Tongva who formerly made it home called the island Pimu’gna (“place of the Pimu”) and themselvesPimugnans or Pimuvit. Their largest villages were located near the present day sites of Avalon, Emerald Bay, and Shark Harbor.<br><br>Upon visiting in 1542, Cabrillo, named the island San Salvador. In 1602, Vizcaíno “discovered” it on the Eve of Saint Catherine’s Day and thus renamed it Santa Catalina Island. Mexico granted the island to Thomas M. Robbins in 1846. In 1850 Robbins sold the island to José María Covarrubias who in 1853 sold it to Albert Packard who in turn sold it to James Lick.<br>AvalonAfter the end of the Civil War, real estate developer George Shatto was the first to capitalize on the island’s potential as a tourist destination and built the island’s first hotel, Hotel Metropole, as well as a pier. His sister-in-law, Etta Whitney, came up with the name Avalon for the resort, inspired by Alfred, Lord Tennyson‘s poem “Idylls of the King.” Shatto soon defaulted on his loan and ownership returned to the Lick estate.<br><br>The Santa Catalina Island Company was established by the sons of Phineas Banning in 1891 with the intention of further developing the island as a resort. In addition to promoting Avalon, the Banning brothers developed inland roads for stagecoach tours and to access hunting lodges. They also built homes for themselves at Descanso Canyon and in what’s now Two Harbors. Their efforts were majorly set back when a fire destroyed most of Avalon on 29 November, 1915. In 1919 the brothers were forced to sell shares of their company.<br><br>After visiting the island with his family, William Wrigley, Jr. purchased most of the island’s shares and thus gained controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Company. To drum up publicity, Wrigley’s Chicago Cubs began using the island for spring training in 1921 and stayed at the Hotel St. Catherine in Descanso Bay. Wrigley built the iconic Catalina Casino in 1929. In the 1920s and ‘30s it was a popular getaway for movie stars and other celebrities. Today, 90% of Catalina’s residents live in Avalon. There are five native land mammals on the island — a subspecies of California Ground Squirrel, the Santa Catalina Island Harvest Mouse, the Santa Catalina Island Deer Mouse, the Ornate Shrew, and the Island Fox. In addition to the fox, the most recognizable fauna icon of the island is the American Bison, introduced in 1924 for a film, The Vanishing American.<br><br>Santa Catalina is easily accessed by use of the Catalina Express. Passenger ferries depart from Dana Point, Long Beach, Marina del Rey, Newport Beach, and San Pedro. Tickets for the boat aren’t cheap… except on your birthday, when they’re free! Helicopters also connect Long Beach and San Pedro to the island.<br><br>Santa Catalina was sung about in the song “26 Miles,” by The Four Preps — which is referenced in the title of this piece. Additionally, it’s been mentioned or referenced in songs including Harry Carroll and Harold Atteridge‘s “By the Beautiful Sea” (1914), Al Jolson and Vincent Rose‘s “Avalon” (1920), Nacio Herb Brown and Grant Clarke‘s “Avalon Town” (1928), Carrie Jacobs-Bond‘s “California” (1929), Cliff Friend and Con Conrad‘s “California” (1930), Harold Spina‘s “Santa Catalina” (1946), Gorden Vanderburg‘s “Catalina Honeymoon” (1953), The Descendents’ “Catalina” (1982), and Modern Skirts’ “Pasadena” (2005). Every year the island hosts the Catalina Island Jazztrax Festival. It was also the recording site of John Tesh: The Avalon Concert (1997).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2013/06/27/where-the-samba-takes-you-out-of-nowhere-visiting-santa-catalina-island-and-avalon-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Happy Valley is an old barrio, located in a small valley between Lincoln Heights and Montecito Heights. The main corridors are Lincoln Park Avenue in the south (the southern border is at Broadway) and Sierra Street in the north (on which Happy Valley Apartments are situated). The area traditionally claimed by Happy Valley Rifa – a long-present gang in the neighborhood – is hemmed in by Lincoln Park to the west, Broadway to the south, Mission and Huntington to the east, and Mercury to the north. It’s an almost entirely residential neighborhood with the exception of one church, two schools, an auto shop, and a liquor store. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2013/12/05/between-olympus-and-paradise-exploring-happy-valley-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

It’s part of the Arroyo Seco Neighborhood Council (ASNC) and the LA Department of Transportation has installed signs at its borders. In 1971, The Monterey Hills Redevelopment Project proposed building over a thousand units on a previously undisturbed hillside. Twenty years later many of them suffered severe structural damage resulting in high profile court battles. The cultural highlight is the annual Monterey Hills Jazz Festival. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2013/12/05/between-olympus-and-paradise-exploring-happy-valley-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Garvanza is a tiny neighborhood considered by many to be part of the larger Highland Park neighborhood that was a major center of the California Arts & Crafts movement. It’s named after the garbanzo beans that purportedly flourished there after being planted by Don Julio Verdugo in 1833. In 2007, the neighborhood was made an Historical Preservation Overlay Zone. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2014/01/16/garbanzo-ramble-exploring-the-garvanza-neighborhood-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[North Hollywood isn’t its own municipality like West Hollywood is, but it’s not really ever considered to be part of Hollywood (like East Hollywood is). It began as town called Toluca and was renamed Lankershim in 1896. It became North Hollywood in 1927. In 1939, in one of the first instances of a Valley neighborhood breaking off from another to distance itself from perceived negative connotations, Valley Village declared independence from North Hollywood. It is home to the NoHo Arts District. The population is 58% Latino (primarily Mexican and Salvadoran), 27% white (primarily Armenian), 6% Asian and 6% black.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2014/02/01/the-gateway-to-the-valley-exploring-north-hollywood-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Half-square-mile Hermon was established in 1903 as a colony by the Free Methodists, who purchased the valley area from Ralph Rogers, who’d previously struggled to sell his isolated property. The Methodists named it after the Biblical landmark in Syria (currently occupied by Israel). It was annexed by Los Angeles in 1912. Hermon streets including Ebey, Coleman, Terrill and Redfield were named after clergy. Today it has a small commercial district but is primarily residential. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2014/01/03/from-the-lions-dens-and-the-mountain-haunts-of-leopards-exploring-hermon-at-the-amoeblog/]]></description>

      <name>San Clemente Island</name>
      <description><![CDATA[San Clemente Island is 147 square kilometers in area. Its highest peak is the 599 meter high Vista Point. Though officially uninhabited, at any point there are about 300 Navy personnel stationed at the island’s military base.<br><br>The Island was likely first inhabited by the Chumash, whose skeletons might be among those discovered at the ancient battle sites. The island was known as Kiingkenga by the Tongva and included several villages including Guinguina and Kinkipar.<br><br>In 1542 Cabrillo renamed it Victoria. Since Vizcaíno spotted it on the Eve of Saint Clement’s Day in 1602, he re-named it San Clemente Island. The city of San Clemente in South Orange County is named after the island. Salvador Ramirez likely introduced goats to the island from Catalina in 1875. The navy acquired the island in 1934. By 1972 there were about 11,000 feral goats wreaking devastation on the island’s ecosystem and in 1980 the Navy announced their intention of terminating the remaining 4,000 or so with extreme prejudice. Horrified, the Fund for Animals intervened and captured and relocated them to the mainland and the San Clemente Goat is now recognized as a distinct breed. There’s even a San Clemente Island Goat Association.<br><br>The island remains home to the endangered the San Clemente Island Loggerhead Shrike and the San Clemente Island Fox.<br><br>https://ericbrightwell.com/2013/11/20/california-fools-gold-a-channel-islands-primer/]]></description>

When other studios followed, it came to be known as Studio City. In 1955, its First Station 78 became the city’s first integrated one. Nowadays it remains largely devoted to various studios and thus has some of the lowest residential density in the city.

It was the Valley’s first planned community — designed by racist industrialist Henry J. Kaiser as a self-sufficient European-American community and not a commuter bedroom community for people working in the Los Angeles basin. It’s also home to the nation’s first two-story Wal-Mart. Though Kaiser and his partners initially barred non-white Americans from living in the neighborhood, the population of their community is now only 12% white. The rest is 70% Latino (primarily Mexican and Salvadoran), 12% Asian (primarily Filipino) and 4% black.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/11/05/california-fools-gold-a-san-fernando-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <name>NoHo Arts District</name>
      <description><![CDATA[The NoHo Arts District, though somewhat distinguished from the rest of North Hollywood by official-looking Los Angeles Department of Transportation neighborhood signs, is (I believe) generally thought of as being a district of North Hollywood (the “NoHo” of the name is, after all, derived from “North Hollywood”). Because of its stylized capitalization, I assumed it is named after Manhattan‘s SoHo neighborhood and not Westminster, England’s Soho neighborhood. It rivals Hollywood’s Theater District for for the city’s live theater spotlight and has several art galleries, museums, bars and other cultural hubs. It’s a bit of a public transportation hub as well, as both the Red and Orange lines have termini there.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/11/05/california-fools-gold-a-san-fernando-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Baldwin Village</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Baldwin Village was originally nicknamed “The Jungle” for its tropical trees and foliage. In 1969, a member of the Chicago Blackstone Rangers known as T. Rodgers moved to Los Angeles and started a chapter in the West Adams/Jefferson Park area known as Black P Stone Rangers. Eventually there were hundreds of that gang’s members in The Jungle. As a crime-ridden area sullying the otherwise posh reputation of the Baldwin Hills area, “The Jungle” took on a different meaning – that of a wild, dangerous and untamed place — one of the cuts even became known universally as “Sherm Alley.” As a result, in the 1980s people began promoting the use of the Baldwin Village name, hoping to gain more association with nearby, wealthy Baldwin Hills (and the nearby, by-then renamed Baldwin Hills Village). It was famously featured in the climax of Training Day.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/11/29/california-fools-gold-a-south-los-angeles-westside-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Angelus Mesa is a neighborhood in the Crenshaw area — a product of the Eighth District Empowerment Congress‘s “Naming Neighborhoods Project.” Its Angeles Mesa Branch Library was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It’s also home to the Angelus Mesa-name-incorporatingAngeles Mesa Park and Angeles Mesa Elementary – although their names are spelled in keeping with the rest of Los Angeles. I’m not yet sure what accounts for Angelus Mesa’s odd spelling, but at least as early as 1920 there was the Angelus Mesa Land Co. The neighborhood is home to the tallest structure in the region outside the USC campus — the 12-story Good Shepherd Manor, built in 1971.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/11/29/california-fools-gold-a-south-los-angeles-westside-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When Frank Robinson and other notable black sports heroes began moving to Ladera Heights in the 1970s, many other affluent blacks integrated into the neighborhood, which is adjacent to one of the wealthier parts of South LA, Baldwin Hills. In the early 1980s, the neighborhood became a mecca for wealthy black families, a rarity for the Westside. Today, even with LA’s black population declining dramatically, the neighborhood is still 71% black (mostly West African and Trinidadian) and 19% white (mostly English, German and Canadian).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/08/18/california-fools-gold-a-westside-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Eastmont is a neighborhood in East Los Angeles that, like City Terrace, has maintained a somewhat more widely-recognized degree of autonomy than other East Los communities despite having long ago vanished from most maps. It sticks out like an appendage from the rest of East Los and is neighbored by Montebello, Monterey Park, and the City of Commerce and most of the homes were built after World War II. Its name and identity are still preserved in the Eastmont Community Center (established in 1967), Eastmont Intermediate School, Eastmont Paint & Decorating, Eastmont Senior Nutrition, Eastmont Methodist Church, and Eastmont Christian Church.]]></description>

      <name>Maravilla</name>
      <description>Maravilla Park, more commonly known simply as Maravilla today, was first platted in 1911 although significant development didn’t take place until the 1920s. Initially, like much of the Eastside, the early population of Maravilla was diverse, comprised largely of German, Irish, Japanese, and Mexican Americans. By the end of World War II it was overwhelmingly Mexican. In 1945, the Maravilla Housing Project was constructed — rebuilt in 1974 as Nueva Maravilla. The neighborhood identity is still preserved by the Maravilla Historical Society.</description>

      <description><![CDATA[West Compton is an unincorporated community west of Compton. Today, probably in part due to the negative popular associations with the Compton name, many refer to it as West Rancho Dominguez (a reference to Rancho Dominguez… a community which, unlike Compton, it does not lie directly west of). At the time of writing it’s the only remaining black majority neighborhood in South LA’s Eastside. The population is roughly 58% black, 36% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran), 2% Asian and 2% white.

      <description><![CDATA[Willowbrook‘s name comes from the willow-lined shallow brooks and springs that covered the area up through the 19th century. It was still largely rural until the 1980s. Today it is mostly developed although less than most of the region. The population is 53% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran), 44% black and 1% white. Willowbrook is locally notorious as the home of the troubled Martin Luther King Jr Harbor Hospital. It’s also home to the well-known Charles R.

      <name>Sandberg</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Sandberg is a small village located southeast of Quail Lake in Northwest Los Angeles. It is named after Harald Sandberg, a Norwegian immigrant, who along with his brother Albert developed the area in 1882. The Sandberg brothers filed papers to build their home in 1897. Sanberg built a luxurious lodge, Sandberg's Summit Hotel, which opened in 1914 (and was variously referred to as Sandberg's Inn and Sandberg Lodge and Dude Ranch). A year later the Ridge Route opened and the lodge was a popular stop for travelers. In 1918, Harald Sandberg was appointed postmaster of the settlement, and the Sandberg post office opened inside the hotel. A surface weather observation station was built in 1933 and is still in operation.<br><br>Sandberg died on 9 July 1939. By then an alternate route had opened three valleys to the west and business had slowed to a halt and was put up for sale in 1934. The hotel passed through three more sets of hands, those of J.H. Cox, Lillian Grojean, and finally, Walter "Lucky" Stevens, by which time it was dilapidated and mostly unused. On 29 April 1961, Stevens was burning trash when the main lodge caught fire and burned to the ground. Today there are fewer than half a dozen homes in the vicinity and the once-manned weather station is automated.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

Most people would consider the large Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area (which includes Lake Balboa itself as well as Balboa Soccer Fields, Balboa Golf Course and Balboa Sports Center) to be part of the neighborhood (although some would consider them Van Nuys). The lake is surrounded by cherry blossoms and there’s also a Japanese garden called, “The Japanese Garden.” Its population is 49% white (mostly German), 34% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran), 9% Asian and 4% black.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/11/05/california-fools-gold-a-san-fernando-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Warner Center is a romantic, edge city first dreamt up in the 1970s and completed in the 1990s. Its dramatic skyline is formed by three not-very-tall skyscrapers that nonetheless rise above the surrounding low-rises like a theme-park version of a downtown. It’s named after Harry Warner of Warner Brothers Studios and served by the Metro’s Orange Line.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/11/05/california-fools-gold-a-san-fernando-valley-primer/]]></description>

There’s a small downtown with restaurants and shops. Sierra Madre is also home to the company E. Waldo Ward and Son, which was founded over 120 years ago and specializes in fancy olives, jams, jellies, and syrups. Its groves were the first in the US on which Sevilla oranges were planted. The population today is 80% white (mostly German and English), 10% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 5% Asian (mostly Filipino).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Vernon has the smallest population of any incorporated city in California (although that might soon change). It’s motto is “Exclusively Industrial” (take that City of Industry!). The motto isn’t entirely true, Vernon has, after all, some 112 residents. It became industrial around 1919, when two slaughterhouses opened. Eventually it was home to 27 such on a blood-soaked strip of Vernon between Soto and Downey. Vernon is also home to La Villa Basque, a restaurant and beautiful relic of the 1960s (historically, aesthetically and culinarily) that has been used in Mad Men. Iniside it has an amazing Googie coffee shop, a martini lounge and a large dining room. Unfortunately, misguided efforts have been underway to “improve” it with disastrous consequences: loud, horrible music; a cheesy new name (Vivere) — courtesy owner and disgraced former Vernon mayor, Leonis Malberg.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/08/05/california-fools-gold-a-south-los-angeles-eastside-primer/]]></description>

To this day, about 30% of its residents work at factories in nearby Vernon and Commerce. After the decline of American manufacturing in the area, many of the residents moved elsewhere too. The vacuum was filled almost entirely by two groups of Latinos: upwardly mobile families eager to leave the barrios of East Los Angeles, and recent Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants. Today the population is 95% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran) and 3% white.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/08/05/california-fools-gold-a-south-los-angeles-eastside-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Maywood</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Maywood is a city of small charms that was incorporated in 1912 but only named Maywood in 1919. Before that, it was owned by the Laguna Land & Water Company. In 1971, Tapatío hot sauce was invented there. In 2006, it became the sight of heated confrontation between locals and the white supremacist organization the Minutemen when the city announced that it wouldn’t persecute so-called “illegal immigrants” (aka the “undocumented indigenous”). With a large undocumented population, citizens have proven less likely to file formal complaints against the notorious police department. However, a fifteen month investigation by the Attorney General found the police department guilty of “gross misconduct and widespread abuse including unlawful use of force against civilians.” On a more peaceful front, it’s the only city in Southeast Los Angeles to provide free WiFi along several commercial corridors, making it ideal for wardrivers.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Pioneer James George Bell moved from Missouri to the area, which he subsequently farmed, presided over as the first postmaster, and established himself as a noted Freemason, living in the Victorian, eponymous Bell House. In 1896, he graciously leant his name to the town he lived in. Bell (the town, not the man) didn’t see significant growth until the 1920s. In 1925, the Alcazar Theater opened. Not surprisingly, it later became known as the Bell Theater and subsequently, when James was safely gone, the Liberty Theater before it was demolished in the late 1980s. In the 1960s, 15-year-old George Escobedo of Huntington Park stabbed to death two 17-year-olds in the theater’s restroom, Robert Haney of Cudahy and Billie Bogard of Bell Gardens. According to Escobedo, they and two other cornered him and his friend, telling them, “We don’t like surfers round here,” at which point Escobedo jabbed them.<br><br>In other film-related news, AMPAS Executive Director Bruce Davis described Bell as a “Bermuda Triangle for Oscar things” after, in 2000, 55 Oscars were stolen from a City of Bell loading dock… following 4,000 Oscar ballots being misrouted and showing up at Post Office processing center in Bell.<br><br>1989’s Intruder and the 2008 short Cure were filmed in Bell.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Cudahy</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Cudahy holds the distinction of being the second smallest city in Los Angeles County. Its name is taken from meat baron Michael Cudahy, who also lent his name to a suburb of Milwaukee. Cudahy sold railroad lots along the LA River to mostly Midwestern and Southern immigrants who moved to the town in substantial numbers beginning in the 1910s. In the 1920s, the library was still operated out of a private home and records show that the most popular subjects involved gardening and poultry. In fact, the city retained a very rural character into the 1950s when people still rode around town on horseback. It was in 1960, when it was incorporated, that it began to rapidly develop. As small as it is, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that not much happens there and the entertainment industry is no exception.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the northwest corner of Southeast Los Angeles, with the Eastside to the north and South Central to the west, the city of Commerce is often called “City of Commerce” and it is indeed where it takes place, if the “it” in question is… commerce. In 1887, when the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway built its main line through the area, the area quickly became industrialized. In the late 1940s, industrial figures, along with residents of Bandini, Rosewood and Bell Gardens, gave the city its name to encourage commerce. It became a city in 1960 to avoid annexation by Los Angeles or Vernon. Whereas many of the Gateway Cities suffered heavily during the deindustrialization of the next two decades, Commerce remains oriented around manufacture and retail.<br><br>The aforementioned outlet mall is the city’s recognizable feature. It was built in 1929 to resemble the palace of Assyrian ruler Šarru-kên II (Sargon II) as the new home for Adolph Schleicher‘s Samson Tire & Rubber Company. Given Hollywood’s vague notions about accuracy, it was featured in Ben-Hur.<br><br>To the south is the rather less impressive, castle-like Shoe City. The various duchies of Commerce are currently ruled by the court of current Miss Commerce, Leilani Davis. 1975’s made-for-TV youth/crime Susan Dey vehicle Cage Without a Key was also filmed there.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

It may look boring outwardly but it has a diverse population of 42% Asian (mostly Chinese,Korean, Taiwanese but also Filipino, Indian and Vietnamese), 31% white, 19% Latino (mostly Mexican) and a small Tongva population.

      <description><![CDATA[Lots in Pomona first went on sale in 1876 but, despite an enormous promotion, the population arrived slowly. Today Pomona is not only the youngest and poorest city of the three Pomona Valley towns… it’s also the largest, with a population over twice the size of the other two combined (it’s the seventh largest city in Los Angeles County after Los Angeles, Long Beach, Glendale, Santa Clarita, Lancaster and Palmdale). That population is 64% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran), 17% white (mostly German), 10% black and 7% Asian.<br><br>Pomona is also notably the home of the Fairplex, which hosts both the LA County Fair and the Auto Club Raceway at Pomona (formerly known as Pomona Raceway). Pomona’s also home of the historic Pomona Fox Theater which opened in 1931 (with a screening of The Minute Man). The Glass House is Pomona’s premier live music venue.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/05/17/california-fools-gold-a-pomona-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <name>La Habra Heights</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Located at the eastern edge of Southeast Los Angeles, the population of tiny, posh La Habra Heights looks more like surrounding Orange County and the San Gabriel Valley than most of the region, being mostly Asian (mostly Chinese, Korean and Indian) and white (mostly Armenian, English, German, Irish and Italian), with a relatively small Latino population. Several mansions were built in the ‘20s and ‘30s for some of the county’s richest citizens of the day, including the Potato Chip Queen, Laura Scudder and Jack Halt, the star of many western films. With avocado-covered hills and filthy rich inhabitants, real estate people often referred to it (and, it should be noted, several other cities) as “the Second Beverly Hills.”<br><br>The short film Gator Armstrong Plays with Dolls is perhaps the only movie shot there and, as is true of most wealthy neighborhoods, no musicians of note have emerged from there.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Whittier</name>
      <description><![CDATA[After the Mexican-American War, German Jacob F. Gerkens bought a portion of the newly-acquired American land, lived in what’s now known as the Jacob Bailey house and became LA’s first Chief of Police. Casa de Governor Pío Pico, the home of the last governor of Mexican California, still stands. A substantial number of Quakers moved to the area and grew citrus and walnuts, making Whittier the biggest producer of the nuts in the state [insert joke about “Hollyweird” here]. Whittier became a city in 1898 and took its name from the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who was not among the Quakers who lived there and, with Quaker-like humility, never visited the city that bears his name.<br><br>Many films are shot either entirely or partially in Whittier, probably due to its varied scenic nature that allows for it to convincingly pass for a variety of locales, as evinced by Blow, Masters of the Universe, The Oh in Ohio, Back to the Future, Back to the Future Part II, Hocus Pocus, Father of the Bride Part II, the final episode of The Wonder Years, Ali, Big Fat Liar, and Disturbia.<br><br>Whittier is also the birthplace of many in the entertainment industry, including Brendon Baerg from Yes, Dear, Caprice Bourret, Adrienne Janic, Martika, Lorna Patterson, Chuck Prophet, Ron Shelton, Eric Stoltz and Tina Yothers. Many ginger and many celebrities (including Carrot Top, Rick Astley and Kathy Griffin) who display ginger tendencies have joined Stoltz and Yothers and turned Whittier into a bit of a ginger preserve.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After the Mexican-American War, German Jacob F. Gerkens bought a portion of the newly-acquired American land, lived in what’s now known as the Jacob Bailey house and became LA’s first Chief of Police. Casa de Governor Pío Pico, the home of the last governor of Mexican California, still stands. A substantial number of Quakers moved to the area and grew citrus and walnuts, making Whittier the biggest producer of the nuts in the state [insert joke about “Hollyweird” here]. Whittier became a city in 1898 and took its name from the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who was not among the Quakers who lived there and, with Quaker-like humility, never visited the city that bears his name.<br><br><br><br>Many films are shot either entirely or partially in Whittier, probably due to its varied scenic nature that allows for it to convincingly pass for a variety of locales, as evinced by Blow, Masters of the Universe, The Oh in Ohio, Back to the Future, Back to the Future Part II, Hocus Pocus, Father of the Bride Part II, the final episode of The Wonder Years, Ali, Big Fat Liar, and Disturbia.<br><br>Whittier is also the birthplace of many in the entertainment industry, including Brendon Baerg from Yes, Dear, Caprice Bourret, Adrienne Janic, Martika, Lorna Patterson, Chuck Prophet, Ron Shelton, Eric Stoltz and Tina Yothers. Many ginger and many celebrities (including Carrot Top, Rick Astley and Kathy Griffin) who display ginger tendencies have joined Stoltz and Yothers and turned Whittier into a bit of a ginger preserve.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Despite being home to the pirate-themed and exclamatorily-named water park, Splash!, La Mirada is famously low key and was recently and appropriately named one of the “Best Places to Live” by the no doubt boring CNN Money Magazine. In keeping with the low excitement level, the town was founded by famous map-publisher Andrew McNally (of Rand, McNally & Co.) and his son-in-law. The two published a booklet titled “The Country Gentleman in California” advertising land covered with citrus and olive groves hoping to attract potential homebuyers to their sleepy town. McNally turned over his home, the flamboyantly-named Windermere Ranch to his daughter’s family in 1896. By the 1940s, the population still numbered just over 200. In 1953, confirming its reputation for orderliness, the town of by then over 8,000 homes prided itself on being “the Nation’s completely planned city.”<br><br>Films including 2007’s Cult, The Black Dawn and the shorts Evil Intentions and Love in the Ruins were shot there, as was Henry Poole is Here, a film shown as inflight entertainment on my last trip and that was so dull that I actually forewent it in favor of looking at Skymall. On the other hand, actress Janine Lindemulder was born there, star of a Vince Neil sex tape and numerous pornos.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[With its connotations of polluted air, deafening noise, gridlock and road rage, it’s hard to imagine a city crowing over its bounty of interstates and congested roadways. Cerritos (aka “The Freeway City”) presumably chose that appellation back when people thought that cigarettes were good for one’s T-zone or that carpets were a good idea. Cerritos, formerly Dairy Valley, became Cerritos in 1967. For the first two years of the ‘70s, it held the distinction of being the fastest growing city in the state. In keeping with the town’s tradition of curious priorities, today citizens of Cerritos boast the New Orleans-style architecture of the Cerritos Auto Square (the world’s largest auto mall), the antiquatedly-spelled “Cerritos Towne Center” (built in ’94) and a big mall built in 1971, Los Cerritos Center. In the 1980s, Cerritos became a favored destination for Filipino immigrants, as well as many Chinese and Koreans. In 1986, an air collision above the city killed 82 and the Cerritos Sculpture Garden was created to commemorate the disaster. Public transportation in the city is courtesy of the propane-fuelled Cerritos On Wheels (COW). The four-acre Pat Nixon Park occupies the site of the former First Lady’s childhood home and truck farm, where she lived from 1914 until 1931.<br><br>The city has many ties to the entertainment industry. The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts opened in 1993 with “Old Blue Eyes” singing four consecutive dates. Cerritos is also the birthplace of Morris Chesnut and the hometown of Roger Lodge. Until Tomorrow Comes, Coneheads, She’s All That and Eli’s Liquor Store were all mostly or entirely filmed there, as was Thunder’s “Boys Like Girls” music video and the short film The First Time.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Hawaiian Gardens</name>
      <description>Part of LA County’s old Dairyland, Hawaiian Gardens (inevitably nicknamed “Hawaiian Garbage”) derives its improbable name from a prohibition-defying “refreshment stand” decorated with in tropical style near Carson and Norwalk. Located in an area known as “the Delta,” with the end of prohibition, the area didn’t have much draw and is now the county’s smallest city. Even today, Hawaiian Gardens prides itself on its tightknit vibe and is famous for having the highest rate of gang associates and injunctees in the county.</description>

      <description><![CDATA[Lakewood is distinct for just how stereotypically suburban it is. After mainly being used to grow lima beans, the next distasteful crop came when loads of small, mass-produced, identical homes were constructed for returning vets and workers at aerospace factories over in Long Beach and the South Bay. The city is laid out with truly maddening uniformity, with boulevards running adjacent to tree-lined frontage roads on block after block. And it’s all oriented around a shopping center in the middle of town. Lakewood’s hopelessly corny slogan, “Tomorrow’s City Today,” is appropriate for such a retro town founded on a quaint, anachronistic, Wonder Years-type vision of the good life. In a note of trivia that only serves to confirm Lakewood’s status as the most suburban of suburbs, in 1953 Harold Butler founded Danny’s Donuts there, which later became Denny’s. In 1993, Lakewood’s wholesome image was challenged by the media scandal surrounding the Spur Posse, a group of high school chooches who gained notoriety as part of the early ‘90s teen sex moral panic when their not especially interesting sexual practices managed to be the subject of national news coverage.<br><br>Due, no doubt, to its über-subürban character, the Leave it to Beaver remake, Mystery Men and the California portions of Nurse Betty were filmed there.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Angeles Crest is the largest "neighborhood." Its residents are 72% white (mostly English, Irish and Lebanese), 12% Latino (mostly Mexican), 10% black and 2% Asian. There are many mountains in the area including Bare Mountain, Blue Ridge, Granite Mountain, Iron Mountain, Monrovia Peak, Morris Reservoir, Mount Baden-Powell, Mount Bliss, Mount Emma, Mount Harvard, Mount Islip, Mount Lawlor, Mount Lewis, Mount Markham, Mount Mooney, Mount Sally, Mount Williamson, Pine Mountain, Rattlesnake Peak, San Antonio Ridge, Silver Mountain, Smith Mountain, Strawberry Peak, Twin Peaks East, Waterman Mountain and Winston Ridge. The tallest mountain is Mount San Antonio, commonly known as Mt. Baldy because of its floral alopecia. Mount Wilson is home to the Mount Wilson Observatory, an astronomical observatory containing two historically important telescopes: the Hale Telescope built in 1908, and the Hooker Telescope, which was the largest telescope in the world from 1917 till 1948 (check out the Mount Wilson webcam). There's also the San Gabriel River-fed Cogswell Reservoir for fun times. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/03/29/california-fools-gold-an-angeles-forest-primer/]]></description>

There’s also the Lemon Grove Recreation Center and park overlooking the noisy, smoggy 101 freeway.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2012/03/26/california-fools-gold-a-hollywood-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[La Cañada-Flintridge holds three distinctions in the Verdugos: it’s the least racially diverse, the oldest, and has the wealthiest population. That’s not to say it’s completely homogenous; after all, it’s 71% white (mostly English and Persian), 20% Asian (mostly Korean) and 5% Latino (mostly Mexican). It’s also home to Descanso Gardens and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Prior to the city’s incorporation in 1976, the area consisted of two distinct communities called La Cañada and Flintridge.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/14/california-fools-gold-a-verdugos-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In 1907, social philosopher William Ellsworth Smythe and real estate speculator Marshall V. Hartranft founded a settlement they envisioned as a utopia called Little Lands. Later Tujunga settlers led by California Poet Laureate John Steven McGroarty and his followers wanted the their town to be known as Verdugo Hills. Nonetheless, it was incorporated in 1925 as Tujunga. It is the birthplace of egomaniacal actor Shia LaBeouf. The current population of Tujunga is approximately 65% white (mostly German), 22% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 7% Asian (mostly Filipino).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/14/california-fools-gold-a-verdugos-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Sunland began life as Monte Vista in 1885, when 8.9 km2 of the Tejunga [sic] Park tract were divided into lots and settled. One tract was planted with olive groves and it was, at the time, the largest in the county. In 1906, Monte Vista became Sunland. Its population is 65% white (mostly German), 22% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 7% Asian (mostly Filipino). Though a separate community, Sunland’s residents share many of their city services with Tujunga to the south.

      <description><![CDATA[Playa del Rey‘s people are 73% white (german, Irish, Persian, English), 10% Latino, 8% Asian, 4% black. Playa del Rey lies beneath the Del Rey Hills, also known as the Westchester Bluffs on a flood plain (until 1824, the mouth of the Los Angeles River) which slopes gradually uphill north to the Santa Monica Mountains. The rolling hills are the result of ancient, wind-blown, compacted sand duneswhich rise up to 125 feet above sea level, with one prominent, steep dune running parallel to the coast, from Playa del Rey, all the way south to Palos Verdes. The northern part was originally wetlands, but the natural flooding was halted by the concrete channel which contains Ballona Creek.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/06/california-fools-gold-a-south-bay-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Much as NWA put Compton on the map, El Segundo reached global conscience when Tribe Called Questrapped about losing his wallet there. The city was named after Chevron‘s second refinery, “El Segundo” (obviously). Today the ‘Gundo’s economy is still centered around petroleum-related industries and aviation. The beach is a popular place to watch planes coming and going from adjacent LAX. El Segundo’s Dockweiler Beach is also one of the few area beaches on which you can enjoy a beach fire. It’s all veryLost Boys – minus the sweaty sax guy. The population is 78% white (mostly German, Irish and Canadian), 10% Latino and 7% Asian (mostly Indian).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/06/california-fools-gold-a-south-bay-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Manhattan Beach</name>
      <description><![CDATA[George H. Peck owned a lot of the land that became part of the north section of Manhattan Beach. Supposedly, a coin flip decided the town’s name. Around 1902, the beach suburb was named “Manhattan” after the developer’s home town, Manhattan Beach, New York. Residents have informally divided the city into several distinct neighborhoods, including “The Village,” “Sand Section,” “Hill Section,” “Tree Section,” “Gas Lamp Section,” Manhattan Heights,” “East Manhattan Beach,”Liberty Village,” “Poet’s Section” (Shelley, Tennyson and Longfellow), and El Porto (North Manhattan). It’s home of the wealthiest population of the beach cities.

      <description><![CDATA[Lawndale is a highly diverse city (52% Latino (mostly Mexican), 22% white, 12% black, and 11% Asian (mostly Vietnamese)). It is usually considered part of the South Bay or The Harbor despite being separated from both bodies of water by other coastal cities and neighborhoods. It was subdivided in 1905 by Charles B. Hopper who named it after a Chicago suburb. Lots sold slowly and different promotions were tried such as promoting Lawndale as a chicken raising area. By the 1980s, it (like most of the inland cities traditionally lumped in with the South Bay) was mostly home to working class people involved in nearby industries rather than wealthy beachfront property owners.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/06/california-fools-gold-a-south-bay-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[San Pedro is a large port district at the southern end of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. On the west side of San Pedro Bay, it was used by Spanish ships beginning in the 1540s. It was annexed by LA in 1909 and includes the neighborhoods of Palisades, Port of Los Angeles, Point Fermin, South Shores, Terminal Island, Vista del Oro, The Gardens, Rolling Hills Highlands and Vinegar Hill. The population is 44% white (mostly Italian), 41% Latino (mostly Mexican), 6% black and 5% Asian. It’s home to the locally famous Vincent Thomas Bridge.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/03/23/california-fools-gold-a-harbor-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Almost landlocked, T Town has a 1.5 mile long beach. The Del Amo Fashion Center, at 232,000 m², is one of the largest malls in the US. In the early 1900s, real estate developer Jared Sidney Torrance and other investors saw the value of creating a mixed industrial-residential community south of Los Angeles. They purchased part of an old Spanish land grant and hired landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to design a new planned community. Historically the El Nido neighborhood was home to many European immigrants, mainly Dutch, German, Greek, Italian and Portuguese people. They were soon joined by Mexican immigrants and today the population is 52% white (mostly German), 29% Asian (mostly Japanese and Korean) and 13% Latino.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/06/california-fools-gold-a-south-bay-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The name Topanga was given to the area by the Tongva and means "a place above." It was the western edge of their homeland. Topanga Creek, which runs through Topanga Canyon, is the third largest watershed entering the Santa Monica Bay. During the 1960s, Topanga Canyon became a destination for many hippies and musicians. The Topanga Corral featured Topanga then-local acts like Canned Heat, Spirit, Little Feat, Spanky and Our Gang, Taj Mahal, Emmylou Harris, Windance, Neil Young, Geronimo Black and many others. The venue is rumored to be the inspiration of The Doors' "Roadhouse Blues." It later burned down and was rebuilt, hosting many local punk bands. In 1986, it burned down again. Today Topanga's population is 88% white (mostly English, German and Canadian), 5% Latino and 4% Asian.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/06/01/california-fools-gold-a-santa-monica-mountains-primer/]]></description>

Before that, the area had been inhabited for some 13,000 years, first by the ancestors of the Chumash, for whom the area was known as "Humaliwo," which translates to "the surf sounds loudly." Malibu is home to some of Los Angeles County's most beautiful beaches, including El Pescador, El Matador, and La Piedra. Today it is also notable for being the whitest community in Los Angeles County, with German and English being the most common ancestries, and Canada and the UK being the most common foreign places of birth.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/06/01/california-fools-gold-a-santa-monica-mountains-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Located in the Simi Hills, tiny Hidden Hills is a a gated development and the wealthiest community in Santa Monica Mountains. It was developed in the 1950s, by A.E. Hanson, known for his previous posh developments including Palos Verdes Estates, Rolling Hills and Beverly Hill's Greenacres. The population is 89% white (mostly Russian, English and Canadian) and 6% Latino (mostly Mexican). To the north of the homes is the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, a park with miles of equestrian, hiking, and mountain biking trails. The city was the setting of a short-lived NBC sitcom called Hidden Hills, which aired in 2002-2003. The 1978 Wes Craven horror film Summer Of Fear aka Stranger In Our House was filmed in the community. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/06/01/california-fools-gold-a-santa-monica-mountains-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Calabasas</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Calabasas is one of the oldest areas of European settlement in the county. The Leonis Adobe, in Old Town, was built in 1844 and still stands. During the Dot Com Bubble of the late 1990s, Calabasas's reputation was rebooted. Due to the arrival of a number of tech companies, largely along Agoura Road, it became known as the "101 Technology Corridor." The nouveau riche favored bland but big McMansions and the town has a very bourgie vibe exemplified by famous reality show figures like the Kardashian family. Today the population is 83% white (mostly Russian, German, Persian and Canadian), 8% Asian and 5% Latino. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/06/01/california-fools-gold-a-santa-monica-mountains-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Santa Clarita</name>
      <description><![CDATA[It may surprise you that Santa Clarita is now the fourth largest city in Los Angeles County (after Los Angeles, Long Beach and Glendale). Urban in size but thoroughly suburban in character, it's a prime example of a boomburb with a population of about 160,000 people of whom roughly 69% are white (mostly German), 21% Latino (mostly Mexican), Asian (mostly Filipino) 5% and black 2%. When it was incorporated in 1987, it was created from a union of the pre-existing communities of Canyon County, Newhall, Saugus and Valencia. The first documented discovery of gold in California took place there in 1842, in Placerita Canyon. It was a popular location for filming, often westerns featuring William S. Hart, Tom Mix, Harry Carey and John Wayne. It's also home of the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and Six Flags Magic Mountain; the latter was featured in films and TV series including Rollercoaster, National Lampoon's Vacation (as Wally World), Step By Step, Entourage, CHiPs, Wonder Woman, Way Out Games, Knight Rider, Beverly Hills, 90210, The King of Queens, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Ridge Route refers both the the Castaic-Tejon Route highway and the large, unincorporated locale around it. There have been several overland routes through the mountains. One included a deep cut known as Beale's Cut, which was lowered in 1904. The Ridge Route highway, when paved with concrete between 1917 and 1921, became the first paved highway linking the Los Angeles Basin with the San Joaquin Valley. Naturally, several businesses opened to serve travelers: The Reservoir Summit Café, Kelly's Half Way Inn, Tumble Inn and Sandberg's Lodge offered luxury to wary travelers during their short lives. Today, only the foundations, concrete steps and partial walls remain of these 20th century ruins. <br>It's home of the large Castaic Lake, an artificial lake on Castaic Creek formed by Castaic Dam. The sparse population of under 2,000 is 70% white (mostly German and English), 20% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 5% Asian (mostly Thai). The area also includes Mount Tejon, Mount Pines, Bald Mountain, Liebre Mountain, Redrock Moutain, Reservoir Hill, Burnt Peak, Slide Mountain, Mount Hiway, Whitaker Peak, Townsend Peak, Loma Verde, Warm Springs Mountain, Sawmill Mountain, Sawtooth Mountain, Quail Lake, Pyramid Lake, Elderberry Forebay and Castaic Lagoon. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Northwest Antelope Valley is a another sparsely-populated area of the valley. The population is 78% white (mostly German and English) and 14% Latino (mostly Mexican). Its Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve draws many visitors who come to enjoy rolling fields of the California state flower. It’s also home to the Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park, Desert Pines Wildlife Sanctuary and Fairmont Reservoir.<br><br>Northeast Antelope Valley is a sparsely-populated area of the valley. Within its borders is the separate community of Lake Los Angeles. The mostly flat terrain is punctuated with several mountains and buttes. There are several parks and wildlife sanctuaries, including the Alpine Butte Wildlife Sanctuary, the Carl O Gerhardy Wildlife Sanctuary, the Mescal Wildlife Sanctuary, Saddleback Butte State Park, Butte Valley Wildflower Sanctuary, the Phacelia Wildlife Sanctuary and the Theodore Payne Wildlife Sanctuary. It’s also home to the Antelope Valley Indian Museum. Since Antelope Valley is a true desert, it is something of a surprise that the largest freshwater wetlands in the county are located there, the Piute Ponds. The ponds are part of the Harley Berhow Recreational Area and support 200 varieties of migratory birds including the Black-crowned night heron, the Great heron, the Great horned owl, and the Western snowy plover. The human residents are 62% white (mostly German and English), 25% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran) and 8% black.<br><br>Southeast Antelope Valley is another sparsely-populated area of the valley. Within its borders are Lake Palmdale, the Blalock Wildlife Sanctuary and Pearblossom Park. Its southern portion is dominated by Angeles National Forest. The population is 76% white (mostly German and Irish) and 16% Latino (mostly Mexican and Colombian).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/05/25/california-fools-gold-an-antelope-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Castaic Canyons "neighborhood" is a sprawling region east of the town of Castaic. Though much larger in area, the population is less than half of Castaic's. The make-up of the small population is roughly 74% white (mostly German and Irish), 17% Latino (mostly Mexican), 4% Asian (mostly Filipino) and 3% black. The nearby Castaic Lake replaced the St. Francis Dam, which was in San Francisquito Canyon to the east until it collapsed in 1928 and killed over 400 people in the Santa Clara River Valley. Within the Canyon's outer borders remains the small, separate community of Green Valley. It's also home to the Bouquet Reservoir, Tule Ridge, Jupiter Mountain, Mount Burn, Brusby Mountain, Del Sur Ridge and Bee Mountain. The area was a popular filming location for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Agua Dulce is a small town of about 4,000. It's probably best known for Vasquez Rocks California State Park which has been used many times in film, including The Flintstones Movie, Duel, Rat Race, More Dead than Alive, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey and, my favorite, the Star Trek episode "The Arena" where Kirk duels a Gorn… a fight scene sometimes regarded as the worst ever filmed. The population today is 84% white (mostly German and English), 11% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 0% Gorn. It's also home to the largest winery in the county.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Quartz Hill is a small town that until the 1970s was largely agricultural, with crops of almonds, alfalfa, as well as turkey farms. With water diverted, alfalfa crops dried up. The almond orchards were destroyed by disease. Nowadays the economy is driven by Lockheed Martin, Northrop Gruman, Staples, Boston Scientific and Starbucks. The population is 74% white (mostly German and Irish), 15% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 6% black.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/05/25/california-fools-gold-an-antelope-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Rolling Hills is home to the wealthiest and oldest neighborhood population in the South Bay. It’s a gated community located on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. If you cruise down Vermont (one of the best drives in LA), it ends down there and gets dark at night. That’s because the city maintains a ranch character with no traffic lights. There are also wide equestrian paths along streets. The population is 76% white (English and German), 14% Asian (Korean) and 5% Latino (Mexican).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/07/06/california-fools-gold-a-south-bay-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Artesia</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Artesia is named after the area’s many artesian wells, which I vaguely remember learning about in my Rocks for Jocks (Geology 101) class. As it suburbanized, most of the dairy farmers moved to Chino or the Central Valley. The stretch of Pioneer Blvd between 183rd and South is known to most people as Little India. There is a huge number of clothing stores, various varieties of Indian restaurants and lots of beauty salons. Pretty much any night (besides Mondays) the sidewalks are bustling with a mostly south Asian crowd. However, Indians only make up a small percentage of greater Artesia and around Little India there are a large number of Korean-owned businesses. Because there are also large numbers of Azoreans, Chinese, Filipinos and Mexicans, the city compromised and the official name of the area is the unfortunately faceless but thankfully rarely-used “International and Cultural Shopping District.”<br><br> <br><br>Michelle Kwan, most famous as an ice-skater but also an occasional voice actor [Arthur (the cartoon, not the films about the lovable alcoholic), Mulan II and others], operates the East West Ice Palace in Artesia. In addition, the film Rising Shores was filmed in Little India… whoops, I mean the International Peoples’ Commercial Consumer Zone of… whatever. Its most famous feature is the water tower atop an artesian well that was featured prominently in Freddy’s Dead – The Final Nightmare.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Paramount</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Paramount, aka (you guessed it) “P-Mount” was created in 1948 when the US Postmaster General ushered the decree that the post offices of Hynes and Clearwater merge together to form one mighty post office on the pre-existing Paramount Boulevard. Before that, the area’s claim to fame was boasting 25,000 cows and Hynes having the second largest hay market in the world, second only to the one in Kansas City, Missouri. The camphor tree at Paramount and Harrison was where the price of hay was set daily for the global hay market and the so-called Paramount Hay Tree is an historical landmark. It was incorporated as a city in ’57 after successfully avoiding annexation by imperialistic Long Beach. Paramount was named an “All-American City” by the National Civic League in 1988.<br><br>If hay is for horses, ice is for skaters and Paramount is important in ice-related sports. Frank Joseph Zamboni Jr, a Paramount native, founded Zamboni & Co. which is still headquartered in Paramount. In 1939, the Zamboni family opened Iceland, an ice skating rink where Sonie Henie and Dorothy Hamill have trained.<br><br>Films and documentaries featuring Paramount include Modern Marvels – Ice, Fun In Acapulco, One More Round and The Ladies Man. Paramount is also the birthplace of actress Melrose Foxxx and was the hometown of singer Adán Sánchez.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Bell Gardens</name>
      <description><![CDATA[In keeping with standard Los Angeles County nicknaming practices, Bell Gardens is frequently referred to as “Bell Garbage” (get it?), although I would prefer “Smell Gardens,” but that doesn’t seem destined to be. Bell Gardens is also named after James Bell. The “gardens” of its name derives from the many Japanese who, early in Bell Gardens’ existence established vegetable gardens and rice fields in the fertile soil. Beginning in the 1930s, cheap homes were constructed, filled largely by defense plant workers. Bell Gardens is also home to the oldest home in Los Angeles County (Casa de Rancho San Antonio or the Henry Gage Mansion), begun in 1795 by Francisco Salvador Lugo and his son, Antonio María Lugo.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Bellflower</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Unlike other Southeast Los Angeles towns with “bell” in the name, Bellflower most likely derives its name from a mispronunciation of Belle Fleur, a type of apple grown by local pioneer William Gregory. How it became the name of the town is something of a mystery, although it was reportedly foisted upon the unknowing townsfolk by a group of so-called “leading citizens.” It originally experienced a jolt of growth when the famed Red Cars made a stop there and the population grew from about 100 to 1200 in just a few years, with Somerset Avenue becoming the center of excitement in town. Before that, its citizens took joy in being “The home of 200,000 laying hens.” By the 1950s and ‘60s, Bellflower Boulevard was a happening thoroughfare popular with those wanting to cruise and Clark Street was known for its shopping. In large part rejecting malls and chains, Bellflower chose to promote mom-and-pop stores and its small-town vibe. Nicknaming itself “The Friendly City,” many of the residents nonetheless moved away to the more modern suburbs of the SFV, SGV and OC. By the ‘90s, Bellflower was nearly bankrupt. Most recently, the media has returned to “The Friendly City” to follow the adventures of Octomom.<br><br>The school scenes of The Invisible Kid, and the short films Picket Guy and Until Next Time were filmed in Bellflower.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Downey</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Downey  was founded by and named after California’s first foreign-born governor, an Irishman, John Gately Downey. Following the establishment of a train stop in 1873, farmers dominated the area growing fruit, grains and castor beans until the 1940s, when it became a suburb organized around Lakewood and Firestone.<br><br>In keeping with its roots in the food industry, Downey holds several lofty distinctions in the storied history of fast food. The McDonalds at Lakewood and Florence opened in 1953 and is the oldest operating example of the chain currently operating. The first Taco Bell opened in Downey in 1962 (at 7112 Firestone Boulevard — it’s now Sea Food & Tacos Raul). In 1958, Harvey’s Broiler (later Johnie’s) was built in the googie/populuxe style. When the owners began illegally demolishing the historical property, citizens intervened and the remaining parts of the structure were incorporated into a Bob’s Big Boy. In addition to its many chain restaurants and donut shops, Downey also is home to the Civic Light Opera, Downey Theater, Downey History Center, Downey Museum of Art and the Rives Mansion.<br><br>Downey has several important musical connections. Downey has its own symphony. Most famously, the Carpenters moved there from Connecticut in 1963. Wenzel’s Music Town opened in 1958, specializing in car stereos serving the then-burgeoning car culture. It was there that Downey Records and its subsidiary, Carmax Records, were born. The Pastel Six, the Rumblers and, most successfully, the Chantays all recorded for the label. In later music history, roots rock act The Blasters formed there in 1979. Metallica’s James Hetfield was born there. It’s also currently home to the eclectic live music venue the Anarchy Library. In films, Downey was featured prominently in Pineapple Express, whose director David Gordon Green chose it, in part, to avoid LA’s cliché filming locations and for its suitable unrecognizability and lack of palm trees.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Norwalk</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Three days after the Anaheim Branch Railroad crossed the “North-walk” for the first time, Gilbert Sproul surveyed the town site that would in 1874 become known as Norwalk. Despite the presence of passenger stop, the area remained lightly populated till the 1940s mostly by Dutch dairy farmers and Tom Lumbard’s cheese factory. In 1957, Norwalk was incorporated as a city. The following year, two planes collided above the city, killing 48 people and a plaque now stands in front of the mini-mall at Firestone and Pioneer commemorating the disaster. In keeping with its origins as a glorified train stop, Norwalk is now accessible to many additional transportation lines, including the green line, metrolink, 105, 605, 5 and 91 freeways (take that Cerritos!). The population grew heavily in the 1990s, when many Asian and Mexican immigrants relocated to Norwalk after being priced out of Cerritos and Orange County. Norwalk was in the news a few years ago when one of its citizens, Cindy Sheehan, became famous for protesting the Occupation of Iraq, making a second home, of sorts, in front of George W. Bush’s Texas ranch.<br><br>In addition to its primary claim to fame revolving around cheese, highways and an air disaster, Norwalk also has a noteworthy musical history– it is the birthplace of Tiffany, Gene Taylor and Delinquent Habits as well as the hometown of Poncho Sanchez.<br><br>In film history, it was the home of the incomparable William Conrad and several films have featured Excelsior High School, Norwalk Greyhound Station and other Norwalk locations, including 1946’s The Postman Always Rings Twice, Grease 2, High School USA, The Karate Kid, Things To Do in Denver When You’re Dead, Best Men, Another Day in Paradise, Life, Corvette Summer, the TV series Heroes, Cutting Class, Speed and Frailty.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2009/04/28/california-fools-gold-a-southeast-los-angeles-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Temple City began when the town of Temple was originated on May 30, 1923 when Walter P. Temple purchased 2 km2 that had til then been part of Lucky Baldwin’s Rancho Santa Anita.

      <name>La Verne</name>
      <description><![CDATA[The name “La Verne” just sounds old and indeed its population is the oldest of the three towns. However, it used to sound even older, beginning its existence as Lordsburg, named after founder Isaac Lord.

Its demographics are 64% White (mostly German), 23% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 7% Asian (mostly Filipino). And, although possessing a comparatively low profile, Amoeba’s own Paul Vasquez DJed a party there thrown by David Koresh.

      <description><![CDATA[Located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, Glendora was founded on April 1, 1887 by George D. Whitcomb, who’d moved to California from Illinois in the early 1880s after having previously foundedWhitcomb Locomotive Works in Chicago and Rochelle. He supposedly devised the name “Glendora” by combining the name of his wife, Leadora Bennett Whitcomb, with the location of his home in a glen of the San Gabriel Mountains. Nowadays it’s an upscale city with neighborhoods including Morgan Ranch, Gordon Highlands, Bluebird Hill, Silent Ranch, Oakhart Estates and Easley Canyon Estates. The population is 67% white (mostly German), 22% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 7% Asian (mostly Filipino).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Azusa is located at the entrance to the San Gabriel Canyon on the east side of the San Gabriel River. Azusa was once home to the Lucky Lager brewery, built in 1949, but which was purchased by Miller in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the operation was moved to Irwindale and Azusa’s beer facility was demolished. Although it probably has nothing to do with Miller’s awful taste, in 1980, it was announced that the groundwater there was contaminated with trichloroethylene and part of it was subsequently declared a Superfund Site. In pop culture, the Old Time Radio Jack Benny Program involved a character announcing the arrival or departure of a train to or from “Anaheim, Azusa, and Cuc-a-monga” (hilarious, huh?). Today the population is 64% Latino (mostly Mexican), 24% white (mostly German) and 6% Asian (mostly Filipino).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[San Dimas is named after the San Dimas Canyon of the San Gabriel Mountains in the foothills of which it is located. San Dimas was a thief who was crucified. It’s where the 1989 film Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure and the 1991 sequel Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey were set (supposedly a third installment is on the way!). It’s also home to the Raging Waters theme park. The population is 61% white (mostly German), 24% Latino (mostly Mexican) and 9% Asian (mostly Filipino).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The city of Covina (a combination of “cove” and “vine”) was named by a young engineer, Frederick Eaton, who surveyed the area. The city’s slogan, “One Mile Square and All There” was coined when the incorporated area was only (or slightly less than) one square mile, making it the smallest city in area in the country at the time. As far as the “all there,” that’s long been even more contentious although Covina does claim to have the largest movie multiplex in the county. The population is 42% white (German), 40% Latino (mostly Mexican), 10% Asian (mostly Filipino) and 5% black.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Baldwin Park is the youngest community in the San Gabriel Valley with a population that is 79% Latino (mostly Mexican), 12% Asian (mostly Filipino) and 7% white. It began life as Vineland in 1860. In 1906 it changed its name to Baldwin Park, after Elias J. “Lucky” Baldwin. Baldwin Park was home to the first In-N-Out burger stand (also the state’s first drive-thru), opened on 22 October 1948. Lest Baldwin Park have anything interesting about it, the first In-N-Out was finally destroyed on 14 April 2011.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Irwindale is, ethnically speaking, the least diverse city in San Gabriel Valley; it’s 88% Latino (mostly Mexican and Costa Rican) and 8% white (mostly German). The city is dominated by rock quarries and is also home to The Irwindale Speedway, the Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area and a Miller Brewing Company which also shills macro-brewed swill under the Olympia and Hamm’s names to gullible hipsters more interested in cans than their contents. In 2005, Irwindale became the new permanent site for the annual Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/24/california-fools-gold-a-san-gabriel-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Lake Hughes</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Lake Hughes is a small town in the Lake Towns area of Northern Los Angeles County, adjacent to Elizabeth Lake but very different in character, even though the population breakdown (76% white (mostly German, Irish, Canadian and English), 16% Latino (mostly Mexican), 4% black and 1% Asian) is, statistically speaking, almost identical ethnically. The town of Lake Hughes was named for Judge Griffith Patrick Hughes, who broke his town off from Elizabeth Lake in 1924, hoping to create a recreation area. The center of culture is the Rock Inn, built by Joel Hurd, Sr in 1929. It originally served as an inn, general store, post office and gas station and today it still attracts a lot of bikers. Roy Rogers and Dale Evans also moved to Lake Hughes in 1947 and established their Sky Haven Ranch. Paul Newman founded the Painted Turtle camp in the town in 1999 for use by terminal and chronically ill children.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Elizabeth Lake</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Lake is small town in Northwest Los Angeles County's Lake Towns area in the north. Elizabeth Lake is one of a series of sag lakes surrounded by rolling hills and known to the indigenous Tataviam as Kivarum. In 1780, Father Junipero Serra named the lake La Laguna de Diablo because it was believed to be the home of a monster, now known as the Elizabeth Lake Monster. Other names it had include Rabbitt and La Laguna de Chico Lopez. Its current name stuck after a vacationing woman named Elizabeth Wingfield fell in (and was uninjured) in 1849. The population is roughly 76% white (mostly German, Irish, Canadian and English), 16% Latino (mostly Mexican), 4% black and 1% Asian. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Castaic</name>
      <description><![CDATA[The name Castaic is derived from the Chumash word Kashtuk, meaning "eyes." Not really sure what the connection is, but that's what I'm told. After the original Ridge Route opened in 1915, several businesses arrived in Castaic. Castaic Brick was founded in 1927 and George Dunn's Wayside Dairy was founded in 1929. They, along with the no-longer extant Sam's Place, were some of the earliest arrivals in modern times. The old Ridge Route is gone but Castaic still supports a population of nearly 17,000 people of whom are 47% white (mostly German and Irish), 32% Latino (mostly Mexican), 13% black and 6% Asian (mostly Filipino).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Val Verde</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Val Verde is a small, rural town that was established by Spaniards in the 19th century after gold was discovered in the area. In the mid-1920s, a town named Eureka was established in the same place, designed as resort community for blacks who were otherwise largely banned from public beaches and swimming pools in the county. It was nicknamed the Black Palm Springs but after racist restrictive housing codes were abolished, the black population largely fanned out to other areas. Today the population is 50% Latino (mostly Mexican and Guatemalan), 38% white (mostly Irish), 7% black and 1% Asian. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/04/04/california-fools-gold-a-northwest-los-angeles-county-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Acton is a small community founded above the valley floor in the Sierra Pelona Mountains in 1887 by gold miners. Its first hotel and saloon, The 49er, opened in 1889 and is still open for business. Acton appeared inArmy of Darkness, Blood Work, Duel, Little Miss Sunshine and Terminator 3. The videos for Radiohead‘s “High and Dry,” Metallica‘s “The Day That Never Comes,” and Tom Petty‘s “Swingin” were also filmed in various Acton locales. It’s also home to the Polsa Rosa Movie Ranch. Acton is also the least diverse community in the valley, with a population that’s 81% white (mostly German, Irish and Canadian) and 12% Latino (mostly Mexican).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/05/25/california-fools-gold-an-antelope-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Affluent Leona Valley, located where the Sierra Pelona Mountains meet the Mojave Desert, is the wealthiest community in the Antelope Valley. The land was purchased in 1913 by Frank D. Hall who established a dairy farm in the Leonis Valley (which he renamed, “Leona”). The farm failed and in 1922, it was subdivided and sold to new residents. Today, the residents are 80% white (mostly German and English), 7% Latino and 6% Asian (mostly Vietnamese and Indian).<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/05/25/california-fools-gold-an-antelope-valley-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Signal Hill</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Signal Hill is a small city surrounded completely by Long Beach. The hill was used by the Tongva for signal fires, giving it its name. Signal Hill is like the Vatican City of the Harbor if you replaced Catholicism with oil. Completely surrounded by Long Beach, every aspect of the small city is coated with the sheen of black gold, discovered in 1921 when Shell Oil Company‘s Alamitos #1 well erupted and Signal Hill became one of the world’s most productive oil fields. With over 100 wells, it earned the nickname “Porcupine Hill.”<br><br>In 1924, it successfully resisted Long Beach’s imperialist advances. Perhaps symbolizing its small but scrappy image, one famous resident, boxer Tod “Kid Mexico” Faulkner became the California bantamweight champion after lying about his age (he was just fourteen) the following year.<br><br>During the 1913-1923 operation of Long Beach’s Balboa Amusement Producing Company, Signal Hill was used for outdoor shooting locations for films starring Buster Keaton and Fatty Arbuckle. It was largely a Japanese-American agricultural area until oil was discovered. Nowadays its population is 36% white, 29% Latino (mostly Mexican), 19% Asian (mostly Cambodian) and 11% black.<br><br>Before the discovery of oil, Signal Hill was home to an early silent film studio, Balboa Amusement Producing Company (1913-1923). The novel Oil! was written whilst Upton Sinclair lived in Long Beach, inspired by Signal Hill and loosely adapted as There Will Be Blood. And Signal Oil is familiar to radio fansfor The Whistler, the most popular West Coast radio drama. “Let that whistle be your signal for the Signal Oil program, the Whistler!”<br><br>Signal Hill was also the primary filming location for Broke Ground, Moving Violation and The Hideous Sun Demon as well as the the carnival scene of the 2006-remake of When a Stranger Calls.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/03/23/california-fools-gold-a-harbor-primer/]]></description>

Today there are abandoned cabins in various states of ruin, which in the 1950s were part of the Falling Springs Resort. I haven't been able to figure out much else about it, such as when it opened or closed, but it was long ago abandoned and nineteen cabins burned during the Curve Fire of 2001. Nearby is a decommissioned fire station and camp and no one seems to currently live there.<br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/03/29/california-fools-gold-an-angeles-forest-primer/]]></description>

      <name>Baldwin Vista</name>
      <description>Baldwin Vista is a neighborhood in the Baldwin Hills area that lies south (I think) of Coliseum Street and west of La Brea Boulevard. There are many mid-century Modernist homes built at the time of the neighborhood’s development in the 1940s and ’50s. It’s designation is a result of the Eighth District Empowerment Congress‘s “Naming Neighborhoods Project.”</description>

      <description><![CDATA[Inglewood traditionally considered to be part of the South Bay. Despite its nickname of “Inglehood,” it’s actually quite safe, well-kept and middle-class and looks sort of like the poorer communities that it stands in for in films albeit with larger, better maintained yards and houses and a slightly more traditionally urban feel in part provided by a couple of not-especially-tall skyscrapers: Inglewood City Hall, Comerica Building, and the La Cienega Business Center. Occasionally films are actually set in Inglewood, like The Wood. <br><br>Today Inglewood’s population is 46% black, 46% Latino (mostly Mexican and Salvadoran) and 4% white. Ironically, Inglewood was once a hotbed of white supremacism and, as late as 1931, the Klan still maintained a chapter there. In 1960, there were 63,390 residents of Inglewood, only 29 of whom were black. Embarrassingly recently (22 July , 1970) Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Max F. Deutz ordered Inglewood schools to desegregate. Large numbers of Inglewood’s white population left as a result and the black population grew significantly. Beginning in the 1980s, the Inglewood’s Latino population skyrocketed. <br><br>http://ericbrightwell.com/2011/11/29/california-fools-gold-a-south-los-angeles-westside-primer/]]></description>

I'm assuming that it's existence is related to the bottled water company of the same name, acquired by Sparkletts. As far as I know, there's just one home in the area, but nevertheless, Big Rock Springs appears on many maps.]]></description>

      <name>Paradise Springs</name>
      <description><![CDATA[Paradise Springs is located on the north face of the San Gabriel Mountains, above the Antelope Valley. It's dominated by a 58 hectare property known as Paradise Springs at Big Rock Creek, developed as a retreat by Pasadena attorney Louis Luckell in the early 20th century. It was purchased by Missouri-born actors Noah and Wallace Beery, who built 27 stone cabins, an elegant ballroom, a dining hall, and other features on the property. During the Depression, Noah went into partnership with Phil DeMerce, and turned it into a public recreation area. After a fire destroyed the ballroom and a flood many of the cabins, the resort went bankrupt, and was re-acquired by Luckell. In 1971, family member Gunner Payne and a group of Quakers formed a partnership and reopened it as a campground and retreat center. In 1981, it was again sold, but remains a "family-friendly" retreat center.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ravenna is a small settlement located along the banks of the Santa Clara River in Soledad Canyon. It emerged as a mining camp around 1860, with the discovery of copper and silver in Soledad Canyon. Most of the residents lived in cabins and tents, colloquially known as Soledad City. When it came time to establish a post office, the Postal Service rejected Soledad City for sounding too similar to Soledad in Northern California. The local grocer, James O'Reilly, suggested Ravenna, in honor of local saloon owner Manuel Ravenna and the name became official on 12 June 1868. Trains arrived in 1876, but by then the mines were closing as most miners moved to nearby Acton. Although largely a ghost town, Ravenna is now home to Heisenberg Heights at Stallions Oak Ranch, Polsa Rosa Ranch, and Soledad Canyon RV & Camping Resort.]]></description>

It's home to a compound operated by the Alamo Christian Foundation, a hippie cult founded in Hollywood in 1969 by convicted child sex offender Tony Alamo (né Bernie Lazar Hoffman). Alamo was imprisoned in 1994 for tax evasion and is currently serving a 175-year-sentence for transporting five minors across state lines for sex. The Hollywood compound was reportedly subjected to numerous raids, prompting the cult to relocate to a former restaurant in Sleepy Valley. There are a few dozen homes in the community too -- presumably with little or no connection to the cult, as well as the odd business.]]></description>

One is a Griffith Park-adjacent community in the Hollywood Hills and the other is a small community in Spade Spring Canyon. Oaks Garage & Refreshment Stand opened on Mint Canyon Road (now Sierra Highway) in 1917. In 1923, proprietors William A. and Rachel Dodrill (and Rachel's bricklaying father, Gus Swanson) gave a the filling station and cafe a makeover, giving it the appearance of a small stone castle. The Dodrills sold The Oaks to Chester and Marie Lamar in 1946, and they operated it until 1957. It was purchased by Juan Alonso in 1980, who renamed it Le Chêne, French for "The Oak." The Oaks is also home to a couple of salvage yards and residential subdivisions like Oakgrove.]]></description>
